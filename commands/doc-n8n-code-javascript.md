# doc:n8n-code-javascript

Write JavaScript code in n8n Code nodes. Use when writing JavaScript in n8n, using $input/$json/$node syntax, making HTTP requests with this.helpers / the $helpers global, working with dates using DateTime, troubleshooting Code node errors, choosing between Code node modes, or doing any custom data transformation in n8n. Always use this skill when a workflow needs a Code node — whether for data aggregation, filtering, API calls, format conversion, batch processing logic, or any custom JavaScript. Covers SplitInBatches loop patterns, cross-iteration data, pairedItem, and real-world production patterns. Also use when asked why a Code node or workflow is slow, which execution mode is faster, or how to cut per-item overhead on large datasets. EXCEPTION — for the AI-agent-callable Custom Code Tool (@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolCode, a tool attached to an AI Agent), use the n8n-code-tool skill instead; it has a different runtime contract.
