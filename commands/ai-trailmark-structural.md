# ai:trailmark-structural

Runs full Trailmark structural analysis by building a graph, running `preanalysis()`, and reporting hotspots, taint, blast radius, privilege boundaries, attack surface, and version-gated Trailmark 0.4+/0.5+ data such as proxy counts, subgraph edges, type/reference summaries, and entrypoint attributes. Use when vivisect needs detailed structural data for a target. Triggers: structural analysis, blast radius, taint analysis, complexity hotspots, proxy nodes, type references.
