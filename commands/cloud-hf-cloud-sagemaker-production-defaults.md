# cloud:hf-cloud-sagemaker-production-defaults

Create a SageMaker endpoint (real-time, real-time scale-to-zero, or async) with autoscaling, CloudWatch alarms, and tagging enabled by default. Use this skill whenever about to create a SageMaker endpoint, write deployment code that calls `create_endpoint`, or finalize a deployment after the image URI and IAM role are known. Provides deploy.py for real-time endpoints, deploy_ic.py for real-time endpoints that scale to zero instances via inference components, and deploy_async.py for async endpoints (also scale-to-zero). This is the last step in the SageMaker deployment workflow. Never generate a bare `create_endpoint` call without these defaults — endpoints without autoscaling or alarms are demos, not deployments.
