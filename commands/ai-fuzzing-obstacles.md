# ai:fuzzing-obstacles

Patches past the barriers that stop a fuzzer making progress — checksum and hash verification, magic-value validation, time-based seeds, and other non-deterministic global state. Covers locating the blocking check, neutering it behind a fuzzing build flag, and avoiding the false positives a patch can introduce. Use when a fuzzer is stuck at validation, when coverage shows large regions behind a checksum, or when valid inputs are impractical to generate.
